
The data of averaged velocity-weighted differential cross sections in this work are provided in four compressed files. Targets include germanium (Ge) and xenon (Xe); DM-electron interactions include leading-order spin-dependent short-range (c4) and long-range (d4):  

1. Ge_c4.zip
2. Ge_d4.zip
3. Xe_c4.zip
4. Xe_d4.zip

After decompression, filenames are formatted with DM mass appended at last, for example: 
"data_d4_avDCS_GeLR_0_030GeV.txt" is for DM mass = 0.030 GeV.

In each data file: 
1st column: energy transfer (in keV) 
2nd column: averaged velocity-weighted differential cross sections (in cm^3/keV/day)

Numerical values of \bar{c_4} and \bar{d_4} (see paper for definitions) are used:
\bar{c_4} = 10^-9 GeV^-2
\bar{d_4} = 10^-9
They can be simply rescaled.
